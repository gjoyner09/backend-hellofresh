# HelloFresh Back-End Assignment
## Grey Joyner
## Graduate Software Development Position

### Overview
A back-end API using Rails and PostgreSQL to provide information on recipes and menus

### Deployment
https://hellofreshbackend.herokuapp.com

### Installation instructions
Install the REST Client extension for VS Code for unit testing

### Testing
I have written tests using both the REST Client VS Code extension and Postman. The REST Client tests can be viewed in the client.http folder. Postman seemed to require a paid version to integrate with Github, so I have exported my Postman tests into the HelloFresh.postman_collection.json file.

### Assignment notes
I have not fully completed the assignment, as I was already well over the 4 hour time limit. With more time, I would have liked to add security using an API token or JWT. I also would have liked to better integrate my testing and create a bash script to run all tests. Lastly, I have completed this with a backend stack that I am familiar with (Rails and PostgreSQL), but I am keen to learn other backend stacks with the appropriate amount of time. I am also familiar with Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB but chose to use Rails because it provides a faster path to MVP.
